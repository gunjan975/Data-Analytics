It's very useful for more periods. Haven't used a better alternate. Best product Best pads to use Organic sanitary pads are definitely worth the penny. They are soft, comfortable, and has an amazing absorbing capacity unlike other pads available in the market. At first I thought maybe they're too slim to hold on to heavy flows but I was really amazed to see how good these pads are. The XL size is huge and so are the regular pads! So glad I opted for . Recommended to all. There is no looking back after I started using . Absolutely rash free periods as mentioned. Have tried various organic pads which had some problem or the other and was not satisfied. But this one is jus perfect. Must try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LENGTH: Regular Length 230 mm",11.47,"Very comfortable Simple amazing, using it for the past 1 year, its amazing, go for it girlies. Good product, value for money. Rash - Free Periods The sanitary pads is perfect for me, as it is light and not too thick but doesn't compromise it's absorption. One thing that is unique about this pads is that it has 3 different sizes so that one can use according to the flow of the period. And also one thing that I noticed is that it doesn't stick so well in all types of under garments material, though i don't exactly know which type it is. Feel good Once tried, you will never think of switching to other napkins! Exactly ?? Must try Good This used to be an excellent product. Very good absorption capacity. But now keeps getting worse each time. Absorption is bad, doesn’t stay in place. Terrible leakage and embarrassing situations. Good and big pads as mentioned by weller. Value for money Amazing product and Safe Delivery. 4. Not only are these pads extremely expensive, they cause even more expenses. All the mess they create, you end up using a lot of toilet paper or wipes for cleaning the unabsorbed blood smearing you everywhere. Product is Very good in its own.But It should be a little longer from the back and the wing's length along side of the pads can also be increased. If u hv heavy flow, blindly go for it. , is all waste. By heavy I mean min 12 to 15 pads a day..I rely on . Atleast it's not leaking every 20 min like that of well established brands. Good quality pads I used to buy this because the cotton stays all over the pad but now after 2-3hours it comes at one place like as other company pads it irritates Worst product It very comfortable cloth and size also... 1. It is very soft and comfortable and being organic is the biggest plus. If you have sensitive skin, stay away from this. I got severe rashes worse than what I used to get with commercial brands. Even sofi was better and softer than this. was the best. I thought this would be great but the rashes were so severe that now I don't know what to do with this big pack I got.. I'm writing this after using it for three cycles. Trust me and look for better options. This is my second purchase!! Hope by now you all can realise how good this is! Just try once!! I am sure you're gonna ditch all other napkins you've been using! SUPERB Good ..condition They call it organic....this is jel lock based pads....how can it be organic?? Besides when jelly and blood mixes and after hours passing fungus grows in blood.....and this fungus and jel combination is cause of carcinoma then how can this is helpfull from other products??????? Pads dont leak and very useful during travel hours.... Received a free product, and it worked so well. No leaks, great fit, and smooth texture. It's ideal for sensitive skin and delivers all-day comfort. Very happy with this. No disposable covers Item is very good but seller item send without packing. Useful Adhesion I loved the product Hi, I have been using for at least two years now. But the current order came without individual wrappers for each pad. Not sure if this is a change from the company or the seller. It should be clarified at the time of purchase and made clear on the website.

When i used it for the first time i was seriously out of help, the pad doesnt stick properly to the panties, its wings doesnt stick properly, the only good thing is it is soft and made up of cotton but whats the use when it doesnt stick properly, i am very irritated by the fact that its wings doesnt stick properly and it made me feel so uncomfortable and confidentless. I am never again buyinv those pads, throwing away the left ones and never suggesting anyone to go for it My wife has been using for quite a long time then I decided to give it a try but these are the best sanitary pads she ever had very soft, comfortable and with very good absorption. These are expensive than other brands but worth to spending some extra for the best quality and hygienic. Every single pad comes in a small type of envelope which is good for to disposals.

No thikness but 2hr no leakage Superb Super Comfy Value for Money My favourite pads and i am using since last year. Worry free day, no leakage, awesome absorption. Avarege product Quality of pads are okay but adhesion is so bad I was using another organic brand and bought this one to try out. Felt more comfortable. Doesn’t cause irritation and decent absorption, though u can’t compare absorption with the other inorganic options in the market. I switched to organic pads as the usual brands in the market started causing irritation after a period of time. But if the manufacturers can reduce cost, this could have been option for common women too. I hope to see such trend soon Product was way better before now it’s not that great.. I would love to talk to someone from the company so that I can share my words with them.. I regularly use this product but this time it is damaged Thanks to sanitary pads. Why didn't I get to know earlier? This is absolutely comfortable to wear, does not shrink on the sides preventing leakage. From now on I will be loyal to this brand. Hoping to never be disappointed by niine I have used these pads for one entire period and I have medium to heavy flow. The only con would be that you have to change more often with these pads and the side wings need more work as they leak or don't stick properly. The pads are really soft and absorb well, did not cause any rashes. The disposal bags are also very good. Most of all it saves you the guilt of throwing non-biodegradable pads into the world. Ok Comfort and hygiene The best part is the napkins are super soft. But they are not completely comfortable. Because the pads are extremely soft so they don't provide the support to the back. I felt slightly uncomfortable during my periods while using them. Else it is good. At least, they prevent rashes, and saves you from itching. Helpful",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the 1st two days, they don't last even for 15 minutes. So a pack of 48 really does not last that long. Earlier pads were thicker & more absorbent. Also, they use excessive perfume to prevent smell, and I felt it becomes too overpowering. I also feel there is a chemical coating added, which causes a mild burning sensation It’s the great product by . Good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being thin and soft, these pads are just perfect and comfortable . The absorption is pretty good too. Nice Box packing of pads can be improved. Best one till date Bad packaging I have been using these napkins ever since they are available in market nd found them best for heavy flo but this time the quality is completely changed as they are thinner and harsh as compared to previous one. I m only using these napkins from so many years. They are not skin friendly and irritating during usage. U guys should have upgraded the quality of napkins. Disappointed :( Perfect for heavy flow, soft on the linings, cushion like feel makes you less uncomfortable. Nice product Very, very, very cute ?? Good product for women Good Would definitely recommend to buy this product, retains heat for a long time Must buy Not stick well To comfortable It's a worst product.waste of money.packing also worst.in that pack all pads are in green colour. Only Medium flow packs are there.No heavy flow pads in there. ?? I bought this for using as not only a night pad but most importantly, a day pad. I was stressed by the staining of clothes every night! But this pad being a night pad itself, failed to do the job even of a night pad! It couldn't control the heavy flow and eventually it stained my panty and clothes from one side while sleeping?? this is so disappointing! I won't recommend this to anyone with a heavy flow please don't go for it! Ok It would be lovely if could come up with a fully biodegradable pad along the lines of what has, as it would be so much better for the environment. Doesn't lead to rash, think but effective. I repurchased it Average 1. It is very soft and comfortable and being organic is the biggest plus. Nice Excellent. Go for it If you are unable to bear heat and doesn't like thick and plastic type pads It's the best option. Using from many years. Its light and wideness is enough for anti leakage. l Excellent purchase! Very comfortable Good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Didn't experience side leaks too Not for heavy flow These are my go to pads since a decade. Unfortunately I suffer from a very heavy flow on my 2nd and 3rd days and sometimes this also fails to provide full protection. Otherwise I prefer this as it is a little thicker the way I want my pad to be. I like this product , now it's my third purchase .Good things about this product are pad cotton not harming your skin durin your period days and after using more than 5hrs , no rashes and no itching. It is safe to use and easy to dispose without harming the environment. I suggest you these pads , these are good, price is good . They are really good. You can buy it . ::))) I wish you healthy and happy life. Good Loving the 'go with the flow' size variety concept. The napkins are wide, sturdy, and leak-proof. Best part is, the individual packaging makes disposal neat and easy even in public places. Uncomfortable ???? Best It’s a good product. Overall I would definitely recommend. It super absorbs and you feel relaxed full day /night. Very comfortable and non toxic. I really loved it. Comfortable Useful product Great Worst product It's quite good for longer intervals and heavy flow Comfortable to use Size is small, like Teenager. Not for Elders Lady... Not good according to price I have been using these napkins since a year I guess I recommend these. Must buy Great Product! Brand : Cheap an best rather than small pack It was good .. but for the product I felt lil overpriced Packing regarding I tried this through a free sample and immediately noticed the difference. It’s soft, not bulky, Quality not good. Pad breaks down after few hours of usage. Good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I used to use before and loved it but once I switched to I couldn't go back to . I have now been using for 4-5 years. Even during COVID I had stocked up. My favourite part apart from the super-ultra thin highly-absorbent pads was that it came with the biodegradable pouches. I feel betrayed that the pads no longer come with the Pouches. If it comes with the pad, I will use them if it doesn't I am not going to buy them because I get free ones from hotels or use old news paper. But it feels like that affects the way I purchase this product. It feels like a rip off if you stop giving it with the pads, don't change the price and then charge so much for the pouches. It shows greed and that you don't care about your customers. Comfortable Value for money Product is comfy for womens and girls is always the best choice. Quick absorbing, no leakage, no bad odour.

But it didn't have them. I was really skeptical because earlier I used organic cotton pads of other brand and it used to tear off and I had to change every 2 hours because I go through heavy flow the first 2 days. And it had only regular sized pads. so comfortable and soft As always best Would highly recommend Go for it Girls??

I thought there was an issue with 1 pad, but I have used 2-3 of them now and everytike the same thing has happened. Its has only 40 pads its a fake Cottony soft Here is a very happy customer ????

They don't slide around, there's almost never any leakage even on moderately heavy days, and the best thing is that they don't cause rashes or irritation. The only issue I faced with these pads is that the adhesive on the wings can be a bit too strong for cotton panties, and often leave a bit of residue while removing the pads. If this design choice can be altered, I would give them a 5/5. Four star Must buy best Ok This is a worse products. The sticker on the wings are not stuck properly and there are stickers in the pad and sticking to the skin when using it. How can we check individual pads and see in the packet.

They offer excellent absorbency, staying leak-free even on heavy days. The soft material is gentle on the skin, and they fit snugly without shifting. A bit tricky to open, but overall, they're comfortable, discreet, and highly reliable. Highly recommend! Softness is excellent but not for heavy bleeding days. Bad Highly recommend it for anyone looking for reliable, comfortable, and long-lasting protection during their periods! Will definitely repurchase. Overall it is very good product but this is not suitable for adults. Like m talking about the size of the product. For school going girls size is ideal but for a adult it is in small size. I found it a bit thick for my comfort. Otherwise it's okayish pad. There are better pads available than this one. Very nice....good quality ..worth to money..must buy Bahut badhiya Difficult Very comfortable and absorbent. One thing to note is that it's not as hard-wearing as regular pads, so it needs to be changed quite regularly. Not recommended if you're going to do a hard activity or sports; it will tear. Quantity Nice Go for it + good length : 315 mm ; I’m a skinny girl and this size kinda perfectly covers most part from my belly to heinie ; I used it postpartum. High absorption and very comfortable Best, value for money I m writing this from my husband's account about these pads they are so good, super soft and no leakage problem. I stuck to pads even though they gave rashes but they felt dry. Thank God they made the green one soft and luckily got it so now it doesn't irritate and also feels dry.go for it .it's fragrance is also good Wonderful Best one till date It’s light, soft and feels breathable unlike the other commercial brands due to which there r rashes post the use. Everyone has their own skin type and experience. Completely recommended as it’s Worth trying. Pack of 12 i am order.... But i can received only pack of 11..... * Price may be high but tha quality is amazing I like this ped.ye Mera fevorite ped hai me yahi ped use karti hu ye bahut achha kam karta hai or smell bhi bahut achhi aati he . Harsh on skin It's soft 4. I felt like fulfilling my duty towards mothernature by using biodegradable pads. Felt like I am doing my but to save our ntaure nad planet earth. Definitely go for it. Now I will be a repeat customer for sure. Long flaps with wider back for zero leakage at night, comfortable drying no rashes soft cotton Very worst product and service by Amazon. Delivery Agent is very rude and they refuse to deliver door step. Even customer care will repeat, I am sorry and take responsibility for the issue. But end of the day even you order a replacement it wont be delivered. I really like these pads they are soft on your skin.

From which seller I got this one all the sanitary napkins tear after some time of usage. So I'm not gonna recommend to buy this one from that seller. Definitely is best but do not buy from that seller. None My New Go-To Pads No, it's not good in this prise Quality good Good one but Check expiry date plzzz Poor quality For me, I think the only sad part is that I need the bigger pads more than the regualr ones.. if there was an option to customise them, this would have been the perfect for me..

Bit costly not everyone can afford it Quantity shortage 5nos I love themm cuz I’ve seen padd which are long but not wide but they are so wide???? and they are budget friendly as well I was tired of using other brand pads. They were expensive and yet not good. pads are really soft and comfortable to wear. And they are also 100% cotton, don’t give rash after wear. I love so many things about the product! I have tried a couple of organic and eco-friendly brands. Pee-safe is very comfortable, uses the material it claims it does and is very comfortable. Even the peel-off paper to expose the sticky back is so premium. I switched to this because of rashes and itching and it has helped. Great product. Premium packaging and well designed. Most biodegradable pads have bad clumping and the wings don't stick but no such issues with Pee Safe. Perhaps more effective used in combination with tampons. Only thing, it's expensive.
